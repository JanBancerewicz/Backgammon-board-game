# Backgammon Board Game Implementation in C++

This is a C++ implementation of the classic board game Backgammon. The project aims to provide a playable version of Backgammon using C++ programming language.

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
Make sure you have a C++ compiler installed. The code provided here is compatible with C++11 or later.

## Installation

Clone this repository:

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/JanBancerewicz/Backgammon-board-game.git
```

Compile the code using your C++ compiler:

```bash
g++ -o backgammon game.cpp functions.cpp -std=c++11
```
Run the executable:
```bash
./backgammon
```

## How to play

Backgammon is a two-player game where each player has 15 pieces that move between 24 triangles (points) according to the roll of two dice.

The game will prompt players for their moves. Enter the point number from which you want to move your pieces and the point number to which you want to move them. Follow the on-screen instructions to play the game.
